    "# Profiling with cProfile, and a speedup tip\n",
    "We would love for our Python programs to run as fast as possible, but figuring out how to speed things up requires gathering information about the current state of our code and knowing techniques to speed things up. First and foremost, we need to know where our program is spending its time, and what is relatively slow so we can attack that first. Once we know where the issues are, we can look at options for speeding things up using a technique that solves that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will look at a profiling tool and a technique for making it faster. There are a number of profiling tools available for Python, but the standard profiler distributed with Python is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "[```cProfile```](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) (and ```profile```, the pure Python profiler) are *deterministic* profilers. This means that they will tell you exactly how many times a line of code executes, and how much time it relatively takes to execute. There are profilers that take *non-deterministic* samples of running processes that can also be used to observe running processes and also build a profile by observing many samples over a longer time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that deterministic profilers like ```cProfile``` can significantly slow down the execution of code, the value they provide is in determing where things are slow. For benchmarking purposes, other tools (like ```timeit```) should be used. When combined with a profiler, it is possible to isolate slow code and verify speed improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example\n",
    "To setup the use of ```cProfile```, let's look at a semi realistic example. Let's say that we are maintaining a script that has to check installation fees for retail items from a database. For this example, I'll build the database locally using ```sqlite```, which means it will be pretty fast. However, in real life, this database may be on a remote database server, or might involve a more complex query, or may be a web service. As we move from accessing data in memory, to accessing it off disk, to accessing it over a local network, to accessing a server  that is potentially multiple countries away, we can see speed differences of 10x, 100x, 1000x, or more, and it's helpful to be thinking about [these sorts of numbers](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832.js) in this context.\n",

    "Now that we know where most of our code is spending its time, if we want to make this code faster, what should we do? I'm sure there's a good chance you would say we should just cache the values from the installation fee check in our code. If we are hitting the database more than once for the same value (and it doesn't change often or won't change during the processing of our code), caching makes a lot of sense. You could do this any number of ways, including adding a cache into the ```check_installation_fee``` method with a simple dictionary that stores the results when found and checks for them before hitting the database in future invocations. You could also add this code where you call this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to keep things as simple as possible, let's just use the caching functionality available in the ```functools``` module.  If you're using Python 3.2 or above, the [```lru_cache```](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools.lru_cache) decorator is available, and you can add caching with one line of code. This is a simple \"Least Recently Used\" cache, that will store the results of the function call (keyed by the arguments to the function) and return those values instead of invoking the function in subsequent calls. You have the option to set the cache size and tune this a little bit, check the docs for details."

    "There's more caching options in the ```functools``` module, including a simpler interface for an unbound [cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools.cache) if you're using Python 3.9 or above. You can also easily add a [cached property](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools.cached_property) to your class if you're using Python 3.8 or above. Don't go and write this from scratch unless you are sure these won't work for you.\n",
