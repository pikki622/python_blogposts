    "# Using requests and BeautifulSoup in Python to scrape data\n",
    "The amount of data available on the internet is quite staggering. It is often quite easy to do a quick search and click through to view data on a website. However, if you want to actually use that data in your analysis, you have to be able to fetch it and convert it into a format that is usable. The creators and owners of the websites, however, may not want you do this. They might prefer that you only look at the data, along with its surrounding ads. The fact that you want to use the data for analysis inherently makes it valuable. The data provider most likely makes money from the ads you view as you look at the data, or they may even charge you for access to view the data itself, and so they are incentivized to stop you from fetching it. In this article, I'll show you a very basic way to download data when the simplest methods may not work. It will not work in every case, but you can add it to your toolbox to consider if you need to download some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [previous article](https://www.wrighters.io/analyzing-stock-data-events-with-pandas/) I used the pandas library to download a table from Wikipedia. It worked quite well. Pandas will read an html page, look for tables within the page, then turns every table it finds into a list of `DataFrame`s for you. "

    "If life was simple, this would work for all web pages we ever want to use. However, sometimes it just doesn't work, so we need to dig further into the details of how this works. For example, let's say we want to get historical earnings data from Yahoo! finance. I've talked about one of the Yahoo! finance APIs in [a previous article](https://www.wrighters.io/analyzing-intraday-and-overnight-stock-returns-with-pandas/), but the API I use there doesn't give you granular historical earnings data that is available on the Yahoo! finance earnings pages. Let's just see if we can grab historical earnings data for a symbol, like you will see [here, for AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings/?symbol=AAPL). You can see this page in your browser, and it contains a table of results, but what happens when you try to load it using pandas?"

    "For web sites that return raw html for a request, it should be possible to read the data as long as you can convince the web server that you are not automated software, but a real web browser being read by a human being. If we look at the [source code](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/io/html.py) for `read_html`, we can see that basics of how pandas does this. The code is a bit complex, but feel free to read it over, but basically it does the following:\n",
    "1. fetches the raw html using `urllib`\n",
    "1. uses a parser to parse the raw html, then fetches all the tables\n",

Let's see what happens if we do the simplest request (an HTTP GET request) for the same url using requests. The requests library has methods for each of the HTTP verbs, and we can just pass it the url. It returns a response object that contains the wrapped server response. If you invoke `raise_for_status` on the response, it will raise an `HTTPError` for any error encountered. Install requests with `pip install requests`."

The `get` method is just a thin wrapper to the `request` method, which takes a number of parameters. One that is very important to consider is `headers`, a dict of HTTP headers to pass in on the request. Web browsers always send along an identifier called the [User-Agent](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3). The most logical header to include first is a valid User-Agent. One way to get a value to use is to just see what your current web browser is sending. A handy way to do this is to use DuckDuckGo, it gives you this info when you ask it `my user agent`, like [this](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=my+user+agent).\n",

    "1. Require authentication. You will need to authenticate your requests, which may or may not be easy to do, depending on the authentication method.\n",
    "1. Uses JavaScript for rendering. If a site is rendered in JavaScript, your requests will just return raw JavaScript code and the table (and data) will not be present in the response. There are ways to scrape data on JavaScript sites, but they are much more complicated and involve running a browser instance.\n",

    "On top of all of the above, you should be a good network citizen and not download aggressively from a website, even if they don't block you.

This means accessing it slowly, with lengthy pauses between fetching data.\n",
