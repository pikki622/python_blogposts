    "# Indexing and Selecting in pandas\n",
    "The topic of indexing and selecting data in pandas is core to using pandas, but it can be quite confusing. One reason for that is because over the years pandas has grown organically based on user requests so there are multiple way to select data out of a pandas ```DataFrame``` or ```Series```. Reading through the documentation can be a real challenge, especially for beginners. For more advanced users, it is easy to learn a few techniques and just fall back on your favorite method to access data and not realize that there might be simpler, faster, or more reliable ways to both select and modify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this can be a complicated and confusing topic, I'll break it into a few smaller posts so that it doesn't become overwhelming, working up from the basics to the more complex scenarios. The methods used for selecting and indexing are some of the most confusing methods to work with in pandas due to their different behavior with different argument types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing topics\n",
    "This will be the first of a series of posts covering indexing and selecting data. This post is just going to cover selecting data by index label or integer offsets. In the future, I'll discuss slicing, boolean indexing, the ```query``` method, cross sections, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our test data\n",
    "As we get started, we want some data. But instead of making fake data to work with, let's grab some real data online that is a little more interesting. I live near Chicago, so I looked at the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org) for some datasets. A smaller one I found was the [Individual Landmarks](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Historic-Preservation/Individual-Landmarks/tdab-kixi) dataset. It has text, numeric, and date fields. I'm going to manipulate it a bit to make it useful for explaining more concepts."

But if you don't have an integer value in your index, it will return the value by position. This is convenient, but can be confusing.\n",

    "## Attribute access for columns on a ```DataFrame``` or values in a ```Series```.\n",
    "Another way to select a ```DataFrame``` column or an element in a ```Series``` is using the attribute operator, ```.```. Pandas will automagically create accessors for all ```DataFrame``` columns or for all labels in a ```Series```, provided their name translates to valid Python. This can make life easier for you, especially in an environment with tab-completion like IPython or a Jupyter notebook, but in general, it's best not to use these attributes in production code. Why not?\n",
    "* Your column names may collide with method names on a ```DataFrame``` itself, and in that case you will be accessing something you weren't intending to.\n",
    "* Column names often may not be valid Python identifiers since they may contain spaces or start with (or just be) numbers, so you have to use the longer form anyway.\n",
    "* Using ```[]``` with quoted strings makes your code very clear for others (and future self) to read. \n",
    "* Assigning to a non-existing attribute won't create a new column, it will just create an attribute on the object. (We'll talk about modifying data in subsequent posts, you can read [this article](https://www.wrighters.io/2020/09/10/basic-pandas-how-to-add-a-column-to-a-dataframe/) for details on adding columns to a ```DataFrame```)\n",
    "\n",
    "So hopefully this list reinforces why it's just a bad habit to rely on attribute access. In our data example, we can use attribute access for some of our column names, but because the primary index doesn't make valid Python identifiers, we can't use it on our ```Series``` (L-265 is not a valid Python identifier, for example). But it does work for some situations and may save you a few keystrokes when doing exploratory analysis."
