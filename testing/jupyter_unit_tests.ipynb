    "# Unit testing Python code in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Most of us agree that we should write unit tests, and many of us actually do. This should be especially true for production code, library code, or if you ascribe to test driven development, during the entire development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often Jupyter notebooks running Python are used for data exploration, and so users may not choose (or need) to write unit tests for their notebook code since they typically may be looking at results for each cell as they progress through the notebook, then coming to a conclusion, and moving on. However, in my experience what typically happens with notebooks is soon the code in the notebook moves beyond data exploration and is useful for further work. Or, perhaps the notebook itself produces results that are useful and need to be run on a regular basis. Perhaps the code needs to be maintained and integrated with external data sources. Then it becomes important to ensure that the code in the notebook can be tested and verified. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, what are our options for unit testing notebook code? In this article I'll cover several options for unit testing Python code in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maybe just don't do it?\n",
    "The first option of Jupyter notebook unit testing is to just not do it at all. By this, I don't mean don't unit test your code, but rather *extract* it from the notebook into separate Python modules that you import back into your notebook. That code should be tested the way you usually unit test your code, whether that be with ```unittest```, ```pytest```, ```doctest```, or another unit testing framework. This article won't cover all those frameworks in detail, but a great choice for python developers is to not test inside their Jupyter notebooks, but to use the rich assortment of testing frameworks already available for Python code, and to move code to external modules as soon as possible in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OK, so you can test in a notebook\n",
    "If you end up deciding you want to leave your code inside a Jupyter notebook, there actually are some unit testing options. Before reviewing a few of them, let's just setup a code example that we might encounter in a Jupyter notebook. Let's say your notebook pulls some data from an API, calculates some results from it, then produces some graphs and other data summaries that it persists elsewhere. Maybe there's a function that produces the proper API URL, and we want to unit test that function. This function has some logic that changes the URL format based on the date for the report. Here's a debugged version."

    "Normally, when we test with [```unittest```](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) we would either put our test methods in a separate test module, or possibly we'd mix those methods inside the main module. Then we'd need to execute the ```unittest.main``` method, possibly as the default ```__main__``` method.  We can basically do the same thing in our Jupyter notebook. We can make a ```unitest.TestCase``` class, perform the tests we want, and then just execute the unit tests in any cell. The results of the tests can even be inspected or asserted to include no failures if you want the notebook execution to fail on errors. You just need to save the output of the ```unittest.main``` method and inspect it for errors."

These arguments are JSON serialized, and the current code knows how to handle a wide array of Python types. But it doesn't pass a datetime as an object, for example, but as a string. Since our code makes an attempt to parse strings into dates (after I modified it), it works. In other words, the unit test above is not passing in a ```datetime.date``` to the ```make_url``` method, but rather a string (```2020-01-02```) that is then parsed into a date. How could you pass in a date from the unit test into the notebook code? You have several options. First, you can make a date object in your notebook just for testing purposes and then refer to that in your unit tests."
