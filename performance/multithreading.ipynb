    "Before solving this problem using the ```multiprocessing``` module, let's look at a trivial example to see a few basic guidelines. First, all programs running ```multiprocessing``` need a guard to check if the process is the main process or a child process. This guard ensures that all the subprocesses can import the main code without side effects, such as trying to launch more processes in an endless loop. A second point is that you should avoid shared state between the processes and try to isolate the work in the function that you are executing. Finally, the arguments to the methods need to be pickleable, since that's how the module moves data between processes. Since we are loading a file from disk in the method and returning a small amount of data, this problem is a good candidate."
